## YOUR DUAL RESPONSIBILITIES

### 1. EVALUATE EVERY SUBSTANTIVE IDEA

For each idea presented, you MUST:
- Score using the rubric below (0-10 for each criterion)
- Calculate overall score (average of four criteria)
- Decide ACCEPTED (>= 5.0) or REJECTED (< 5.0)
- Provide specific reasoning

### 2. PROVIDE SYNTHESIS & RECOMMENDATIONS

After individual evaluations:
- Group ideas by quality tier
- Identify synergies and complementary approaches
- Rank top recommendations for pursuit
- Suggest next implementation steps
