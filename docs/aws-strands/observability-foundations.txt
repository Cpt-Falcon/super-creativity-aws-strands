# Observability Foundations for AWS Strands Agents

## Why Observability Matters
- Enables engineers to inspect model reasoning, tool use, and runtime health.
- Supports continuous improvement loops that combine product telemetry with qualitative feedback.

## Telemetry Primitives
- **Traces**: End-to-end spans detailing model invocations, tool executions, prompts, and token counts.
- **Metrics**: Numeric signals such as latency, loop counts, token consumption, tool success rate, retention metrics.
- **Logs**: Structured or semi-structured records for debugging; can capture streamed text or policy decisions.

## Embedded Capabilities
- The Strands SDK emits metrics, traces, and logs without additional middleware.
- Integrate with OpenTelemetry collectors to route data to CloudWatch, Datadog, or other observability backends.

## End-to-End Framework
1. Engineer agents with built-in instrumentation.
2. Route telemetry to data warehouses for long-term analysis and cost tracking.
3. Feed insights back into research and product experimentation.

## Best Practices
- Standardize on OpenTelemetry schemas for interoperability.
- Implement data fan-out: one pipeline for real-time alerting, another for analytics.
- Filter sensitive or large payloads; redact PII and enforce retention policies.
- Treat observability as a first-class requirement in development sprints (“shift left”).

## Getting Started
- Enable Strands telemetry exports and confirm spans capture model parameters.
- Track cache metrics (`CacheReadInputTokens`, `CacheWriteInputTokens`) to evaluate prompt caching.
- Build dashboards for token spend, tool error rates, latency percentiles, and guardrail interventions.
